# kickstarter-updates-navigator

I'm a Kickstarter addict. 

Everyday I browse the app and I click through multiple saved projects which I have late pledged just to see if there's an update. It takes like 2-3 clicks and lots of loading just to get disappointed. I've found the private Kickstarter API and this is the end of my disappointment clicking.
