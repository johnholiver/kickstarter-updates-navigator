# kickstarter-updates-navigator

I'm a Kickstarter addict. 

Everyday I browse the app and I click through multiple saved projects which I have late pledged just to see if there's an update. It takes like 2-3 clicks and lots of loading just to get disappointed. I've found the private Kickstarter API and this is the end of my disappointment clicking.

The original idea of this hobby project was to be a simple webpage, hosted on GitHub Pages that I could visit every time I'd like to, but things started to get a bit complicated.
The Kickstarted API isn't public, I've started to face issues with CORS, not really wanting my secrets exposed, I started to want to add a couple of features to filter and sort by myself.  

Well, it might be a mini playground to try some stuff. 
The latest has been **Vercel** (also heard about Netlify), and using serverless. Since I can't spend a lot of time on this anyway, I'll try it out and make the Kickstarter API access all using Vercel serverless building with Node.
